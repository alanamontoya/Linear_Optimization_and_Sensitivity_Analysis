# Linear_Optimization_and_Sensitivity_Analysis

Summary:

*	Translated a real-world scenario into a solvable linear optimization problem and created relevant scenarios where sensitivity analysis would be useful including range analysis of the objective function, pricing in a new product, and range analysis of the constraints
*	Performed a sensitivity analysis using python and the matrix version of the simplex algorithm to find the optimal solutions of the original scenario and determine the extent to which changes would affect variables.
